# Hello, I'm Julia, Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

I'm a hard-working, optimistic, and ambitious professional passionate about data. Currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science, I am acquiring knowledge in advanced machine and deep learning, natural language processing, time series, big data management and econometrics techniques to provide accurate insights regarding economic and business challenges. 

## Skills
- Programming Languages: [Python, R, SQL, NoSQL, Hadoop, Spark]
  
## Projects

### Project 1: [Amazon Reviews classification]

- Description: With the objective of optimizing the accuracy of binary classification of reviews (good or bad), different deep learning models are employed in the project. In all of them, DistilBERT is used as a base pre-trained model and different techniques are used on top of that. These are data augmentation using Synonym Augmenter, Zero-Shot Learning and Data Generation with LLM using ChatGPT 2 prompt. We also explore the learning curve of the model by training it on different % of the trainning dataset. Finally, we also perform Model Knowledge Distillation using tiny-Bert as a base pre-trained model for our student model.

### Project 2: [Amazon Self-brand preferencing on search rankings]

- Description: In this project we aim at exploring the potential influence of amazon's self-brand products on search ranking position. Using and API, we perform 20 different product searches and scrape all listings obtained, its characteristics (i.e, price, sponsored product indicator, rating, etc) as well as it reviews. We perform minimal preprocessing and data cleansing as well as sentiment analysis on user reviews and add the obtained polarity score as a regressor. We perform two linear regressions, using either rating or polarity score and we compare in both cases the significant coefficients of Amazon brand product and sponsored products dummy variables and draw conclusions.

### Project 3: [Hospital Length of Stay Prediction using Neural Networks and Ensembling Techniques]

- Description: The objective is to optimize the MSE of the prediction of Length of Stay ('LOS') in a ICU based on patient-related characteristics such as vital signs (i.e., HeartRate, SysBP,etc) diagnosis and comorbidities, and personnel data (i.e., age, ethnicity, etc). For such, minimal preprocessing and feature engineering is performed. Prediction techniques used are Neural Networks using Keras library and ensembling techniques such as stacking, blending and subsembling.

### Project 4: [Death Prediction using KNN and SVM classifiers]

- Description: The objective is to optimize the accuracy of prediction of death of patients in a ICU. Data is patient-related characteristics such as vital signs (i.e., HeartRate, SysBP,etc) diagnosis and comorbidities, and personnel data (i.e., age, ethnicity, etc). For such, minimal preprocessing and feature engineering is performed. Prediction techniques used are KNN and SVM classifiers.
